								<h2><a>Introduction</a></h2>
								<p>
									A task was set at the beginning of the module to produce virtual artefacts with the potential of making them physical through the use of a multitude of techniques studied in the time between. 
									A budget of 50GBP pp was allotted, for a total of 150GBP per team of three. For the design, our team decided to work on developing a model of a Tyrannosaurus Rex (T-Rex). We felt that it would be an optimal design choice to allow us to
									include a variety of different techniques, such as utilising the resin lab for a skin texture, and 3D printing for harder textures (such as teeth) and for creating components to allow for motion in the jaw, using a joint.<br>
									The following sections on this page will explore the initial design phase and the techniques available that were considered, as well as a critical analysis of areas where similar techniques have been employed, to decide if it was 
									useful to our design. <br>
									Please note that, in the interest of maintaining a compact and clean design, IEEE style referencing will be used. The Bibliography page will have its own section dedicated to RMADSD, where you can find all references in one place.
									If time allows, each reference will have its own hyperlink. A Bibliography will be included regardless.

							<p>
								Figure 1, which shows the initial sketch of the design (Left) as well as a 3D scan of an actual T-Rex skull (Right)[1], outlined the aim of the design at the initial stage. Whilst a model as detailed as the example on the right was deemed unattainable
								(due to a combined lack of skill, cost of production, and limitations of hardware), it was reasoned that a simpler skull design could be supplemented with additional features to create a complex artefact in a different regard.
								The group decided that the artefact could be wall-mounted, adding a neck to the model as an anchor, and that the jaw could be fitted with bearings/joints to allow for some movement. It was also discussed that a motor could be used
								if the design timeline allowed for it. The motor would be hidden in the neck, with gears being 3d printed to allow asynchronous movement of the jaw and rotation of the head on a pivot from the top of the neck. Furthermore, discussion
								was had over adding skin to the model. This was decided to be done using resin, but was apparent from the start of the design phase that covering the whole model may be too expensive. It was for this reason that the design opted to 
								cover half of the skull in skin, giving it an x-ray view. Whilst it was also debated in having a moving eye on the side covered with resin, this feature was dropped as to not overload the initial design process and allow theoreticals
								to outstretch deliverables.

									<h3>Techniques</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The following sections will explore some of the techniques learnt throughout the module, with reference to their applications in industry and similar works. Whilst there were a multitude of techniques and technologies investigated
									throughout the course of the module, this section will discuss those more closely related to techniques used for the design process outlined in the above sections.

									<h3>3D Modelling Software</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									3D Modelling software has become an indispensible tool for various industries, seeing use in animation, gaming, and architecture [2]. There are also a multitude of softwares available, such as Autodesk, ZBrush, 3Ds Max, and SketchUp, amongst
									others. For the design and modelling of this project, Blender 4.1 was used. As the artefacts were to be made physically, Blender was chosen for its versatility and ability to convert an object into a mesh (which can be better understood
									by a 3D printer for how to print from the bottom up), as well as its real-time rendering capability, which proved significantly useful in observing changes as they occurred in the design. It's power and versatility are enough 
									that the T-rex skull in figure 1 could be replicated if a user had the requisite knowledge and skill of using Blender. <br>
									There are various studies into the viability of 3D modelling software for use in architecture. Most pertain to its usage in visualisation, where architects and designers can explore their ideas in a digital environment before
									committing to the physical construction/implementation [3]. In most cases, the software is used to identify potential issues early in development, or for interior designers - visualise spatial relationships between furniture and other
									housing items to alter or adjust the layout of a room pre-emptively. One could argue a 3D render of a building/room is objectively better than traditional 2D floorplans or blueprints, and affords both designer and client a clearer
									understanding of the requirements/limitations by providing the example in a context. <br>
									The use of 3D modelling software is not without its limitations, however. As mentioned above, a model as detailed and complex as the skull in figure 1 could be made - if they had the requisite skill. For programs such as Blender, one of their key
									limitations is the steep learning curve associated with it, due to its extensive feature set and complex interface. For architects and designers used to conventional 2D floorplans, the time required and difficulty in mastering a 3D modelling can
									be a major hurdle to which they may simply continue with more traditional methods. Furthermore, for more complex and large designs such as buildings, it would require greater computational power else the performance of the software be crippled.
									With an application such as Blender and its advanced lighting engine, a reduction in performance could severely inhibit the production process. <br>
									Overall, whilst 3D modelling software has numerous advantages in its implementation over numerous scenarios, and requires extensive knowledge of the software as well as a suitable platform for efficient production, it can provide an incredible benefit
									to an individual or business if the effort is taken learn the software.
