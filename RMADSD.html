								<h2><a>Introduction</a></h2>
								<p>
									A task was set at the beginning of the module to produce virtual artefacts with the potential of making them physical through the use of a multitude of techniques studied in the time between. 
									A budget of 50GBP pp was allotted, for a total of 150GBP per team of three. For the design, our team decided to work on developing a model of a Tyrannosaurus Rex (T-Rex). We felt that it would be an optimal design choice to allow us to
									include a variety of different techniques, such as utilising the resin lab for a skin texture, and 3D printing for harder textures (such as teeth) and for creating components to allow for motion in the jaw, using a joint.<br>
									The following sections on this page will explore the initial design phase and the techniques available that were considered, as well as a critical analysis of areas where similar techniques have been employed, to decide if it was 
									useful to our design. <br>
									Please note that, in the interest of maintaining a compact and clean design, IEEE style referencing will be used. The Bibliography page will have its own section dedicated to RMADSD, where you can find all references in one place.
									Alternatively, you can use the hyperlinks on each reference ([X]) to take you straight to the source.

								Figure 1, which shows the initial sketch of the design (Left) as well as a 3D scan of an actual T-Rex skull (Right)<a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tyrannosaurus-rex-nhmw-geo-1998z00490001-816d1a0d27e146669f09e6fc2d260dc7" target="_blank">[1]</a>,
								outlined the aim of the design at the initial stage. Whilst a model as detailed as the example on the right was deemed unattainable (due to a combined lack of skill, cost of production, and limitations of hardware), it was reasoned
								that a simpler skull design could be supplemented with additional features to create a complex artefact in a different regard. The group decided that the artefact could be wall-mounted, adding a neck to the model as an anchor, and that 
								the jaw could be fitted with bearings/joints to allow for some movement. It was also discussed that a motor could be used if the design timeline allowed for it. The motor would be hidden in the neck, with gears being 3d printed 
								to allow asynchronous movement of the jaw and rotation of the head on a pivot from the top of the neck. Furthermore, discussion	was had over adding skin to the model. This was decided to be done using resin, but was apparent from
								the start of the design phase that covering the whole model may be too expensive. It was for this reason that the design opted to cover half of the skull in skin, giving it an x-ray view. Whilst it was also debated in having a moving
								eye on the side covered with resin, this feature was dropped as to not overload the initial design process and allow theoreticals to outstretch deliverables.

								<p>
									The following sections will explore some of the techniques learnt throughout the module, with reference to their applications in industry and similar works. Whilst there were a multitude of techniques and technologies investigated
									throughout the course of the module, this section will discuss those more closely related to techniques used for the design process outlined in the above sections.

									<h3>3D Modelling Software</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									3D Modelling software has become an indispensible tool for various industries, seeing use in animation, gaming, and architecture <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-5-321-2014" target="_blank">[2]</a>. There are also a multitude
									of softwares available, such as Autodesk, ZBrush, 3Ds Max, and SketchUp, amongst others. For the design and modelling of this project, Blender 4.1 was used. As the artefacts were to be made physically, Blender was chosen for its versatility 
									and ability to convert an object into a mesh (which can be better understood by a 3D printer for how to print from the bottom up), as well as its real-time rendering capability, which proved significantly useful in observing changes as they 
									occurred in the design. It's power and versatility are enough that the T-rex skull in figure 1 could be replicated if a user had the requisite knowledge and skill of using Blender. <br>
									There are various studies into the viability of 3D modelling software for use in architecture. Most pertain to its usage in visualisation, where architects and designers can explore their ideas in a digital environment before
									committing to the physical construction/implementation <a href="https://papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/paper/ecaade2009_025" target="_blank">[3]</a>. In most cases, the software is used to identify potential issues early in development, 
									or for interior designers - visualise spatial relationships between furniture and other housing items to alter or adjust the layout of a room pre-emptively. One could argue a 3D render of a building/room is objectively better than traditional 
									2D floorplans or blueprints, and affords both designer and client a clearer	understanding of the requirements/limitations by providing the example in a context. <br>
									The use of 3D modelling software is not without its limitations, however. As mentioned above, a model as detailed and complex as the skull in figure 1 could be made - if they had the requisite skill. For programs such as Blender, one of their key
									limitations is the steep learning curve associated with it, due to its extensive feature set and complex interface. For architects and designers used to conventional 2D floorplans, the time required and difficulty in mastering a 3D modelling can
									be a major hurdle to which they may simply continue with more traditional methods. Furthermore, for more complex and large designs such as buildings, it would require greater computational power else the performance of the software be crippled.
									With an application such as Blender and its advanced lighting engine, a reduction in performance could severely inhibit the production process. <br>
									Overall, whilst 3D modelling software has numerous advantages in its implementation over numerous scenarios, and requires extensive knowledge of the software as well as a suitable platform for efficient production, it can provide an incredible benefit
									to an individual or business if the effort is taken learn the software.

									<h3>3D Printing</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									3D printing has revolutionised the way products are designed and manufactured. From rapid prototyping to components for bigger machinery, 3D printing is increasingly seeing adoption in various industries, such as aerospace,
									healthcare, consumer goods, and even housing. Alquist 3D, a company based out of Greeley Colorado, has developed the ability to 3D print houses, with only minor additions to the infrastructure needed once the shell is complete.
									Furthermore, it only requires 3 people, 1 mobile printer, and 1 pump/mix with the requisite material <a href="https://www.alquist3d.com/solutions" target="_blank">[4]</a>. This is clear evidence to suggest that, whilst a large upfront cost, 
									incorporating 3D printing into a business can substantially reduce costs of both labour and production. Another article finds that - with regards to construction companies - the costs can be brought even lower for companies who already 
									utilise 3D printing for components by having them be produced on-site, rather than in a factory, by removing the costs for shipping and storage <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/recycling6030060" target="_blank">[5]</a>. The versatility of 3D
									printing also extends to the materials that can be used for production. With Alquist, concrete is used, but typically thermoplastics such as PLA and ABS would be used in general-purpose applications, due to their affordability. Selective Laser
									Melting (SLM) and Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) can use metals such as aluminium or titanium, for sectors where sturdier components are required in aerospace or medical sectors - though these tend to be less for mass production, 
									and rather limited for specific-use cases. <br>
									While 3D printing undoubtedly has its advantages, it is not without its limitations. Whilst exceptional in producing specific, custom made products, 3D printing is generally ill-suited to mass production due to its slow printing process. When
									looked at on its own, traditional manufacturing methods such as injection moulding or CNC machining are more cost-effective in both time and raw materials. Additionally, there can be a high risk factor in production when using 3D printing for
									a variety of reasons. Inadequate calibration, or a minor variance in quality of the material can lead to a catastrophic failure of the products integrity, causing a loss for production time and potentially rendering the material used wasted. <br>
									Whilst subject to specific-use cases, 3D printing shows incredible potential for various markets. Whilst the need to understand a 3D modelling software could prove a roadblock for an individual, companies such as Alquist are revolutionising 
									the use of 3D printers in industry. With a wider adoption and an ever-increasing list of materials that can be used, and even the emergence of 3D printed plant-based food, it is no understatement to suggest that 3D printing could very well be
									at the forefront of production in the near future.

									<h3>Resin & Moulding Materials</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									There are a multitude of different resins and moulding materials available, and higher still the applications of each in industry. Casting resins see use in the entertainment industry in the creation of props, Silicone has medical uses for anatomical models or prosthetic limbs, and composite resins
									can provide lightweight yet durable components for use in the aerospace industry. Whilst there are many implementations that could be discussed, the following section will analyse and evaluate which would have been the best choice to create a skin texture for the project. The skin texture for the T-rex
									was intended to be added and had been discussed during development, but time constraints did not allow for its production. <br>
									As mentioned previously, the skin texture planned to be fitted to half of the T-rex skull. This was a decision made to cut costs, as it was estimated that the resin would have been the most expensive part of production at around 80GBP. This cost was to account for the size of the skull, and the neck
									which would have served as a mount, and would have been fully covered in the texture to hide the planned motors and gears for the jaw/rotation of the head. Therefore, a large surface area of the artefact would have been covered even with only half of the skull textured. As the texture was
									to be realtively intricate - with grooves and wrinkles to imitate scales - the options for moulding materials was narrowed down to Silicone Rubbers or Casting Resins. Both are well suited to intricate designs, and had their advantages and disadvantages. <br>
									<h1>Epoxy Casting Resins</h1>
									<p>Casting Resins offer numerous advantages such as high strength, and have exceptional adhesion properties. They are also well suited to replicating intricate details with a high accuracy. The cost can vary depending on the type, but for this project, only
									a few different types are available. For casting resins, this ranges from ~16GBP/KG to ~53GBP/KG. Whilst some resins shrink more than others, epoxy resin tends to shrink a lot less. Regardless, the effect of shrinking cannot be overlooked. 
									Ultimately, the change in size could have adverse affects for the project. In worst cases - if done as a single, layered sheet over the skull - this could result in having to cast again, doubling the cost which the project does not have. This could be avoided by making the skin slightly 
									larger than needed, in which case after setting the excess can be removed. A waste, but a significantly lower cost that having to reproduce the skin entirely. Alternatively, multiple smaller sample sheets could be used and attached to the skull piece by piece. Again, there would likely be excess and also a longer processing time for creating the sheets when needed, but it would reduce the risk of the skin not fitting. This
									approach is likely not feasible however, due to the 48 hour curing time of Casting Resins. Even if a large batch was made at once, casting resins also incur a 60-90 minute working time, for aspects such as eliminating air bubbles in the resin with a heat gun. The only viable option
									if casting resins are to be used would be to make an initial larger sheet than needed, to account for the shrinkage. However, even this method has its flaws. Whilst epoxy resins are strong, this means they are not very flexible. For an object such as a skull, which includes
									a lot of curves of varying angles, epoxy would not be able to bend to fit the shape without failing. Whilst an initial vacuum cast of the skull could be taken to capture the shape perfectly (resulting in the skin essentially being worn as a helmet for the skull when produced) 
									A texture would still need to be cast for the skin itself, and overlapping multiple moulds may prove difficult, and increase the risk of failure overall. Additionally, the factor of the epoxy running during the curing phase would either mean a hollow cast of the skin is needed,
									or it would simply pool at the bottom and not function as intended regardless.<br>
									Ultimately, Casting Resins are ill suited to the needs of the design. Whilst they could be used, an increase in the complexity of the casting process could lead to complications and incur costs the project cannot afford.</p>
									<h1>Silicone Rubbers</h1>
									<p>As an alternate solution with similarly high fidelity, Silicone Rubbers provide the flexibility that casting resins lack. Variants such as CS25 and AS40 also have high tear strength, and excellent elongation<a href="https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/cs25-condensation-cure-rtv-silicone-rubber" target="_blank">[6]</a>
									- which is ideal for this project in fitting to a model with various curves. Furthermore, this flexibility and resistance allows for a flat sheet to be used as a mould (with the necessary indentations to replicate scales). The CS25 has a 60-90 minute working time, whereas the AS40 
									has a working time of 30 minutes. Both have a cure time of around 24 hours - up to half the time of casting resins. The downsides however, are mainly that Silicone Rubbers are slightly more expensive than the cheaper epoxy resins, at an average of 22GBP/KG. 
									Both can be dyed to be opaque (as the skull is not meant to be seen through the skin), and the differences between CS25 and AS40 are negligible besides the working time. Due to the higher working time, CS25 will be used as it provides a larger window to mix the potentially high quantity of resin
									needed to fill a mould for the skin.</p><br>
									<h1>Calculating Costs</h1>
									<p>To calculate the cost of the resin, the surface area of the skull needs to be defined to assess how much resin is needed for the skin. Though rough measurements (as the skull is not a cuboid), the dimensions are 14 x 26 x 8 (cm). <br>
									The formula for calculating the surface area of a cubiod is 2((length x width) + (width x height) + (length x height))<br>
									However, the width can be halved as the skull will only have half of it covered with a skin. As there will be no skin down the middle of the skull either, one value for height x length can be subtracted at the end.<br>
									So the (very rough) surface area of the skull can be calculated as follows:<br>
									Total Surface Area = 2 x ((26 x 4) + (4 x 14) + (26 x 14))<br>
									= 2 x (104 + 56 + 364)<br>
									= 2 x 524<br>
									= 1048cm&sup2;.<br>
									Since there is no need for the surface area of the side through the middle, we remove one face (26 x 14)=364.<br>
									Giving us a rough surface area for half of the skull as 684cm&sup2;.<br>
									The thickness of the skin should be around 2cm. Whilst Silicone Rubber is resistant to tearing, with the addition of grooves in the texture to imitate scales, it may leave a structural weakness when stretched and bent to fit the skull. Furthermore, the depth of the grooves
									should leave enough rubber underneath that it also does not provide a potential weakness and leave it susceptible to tearing.<br>
									Using the formula for Volume and adjusting the previous calculations to metres:<br>
									V = 0.0684cm&sup2; x 0.02m = 0.001368m&sup3; <br>
									x 1000 = 1.368 litres. <br>
									Using the values provided by the easycomposites website <a href="https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/cs25-condensation-cure-rtv-silicone-rubber" target="_blank">[6]</a>, 1kg of mixed CS25 silicone is approximately 0.89 litres - meaning the skin would require approximately 1.54kg of CS25.<br>
									After referencing the cost of the resin provided by the university (2.50GBP/100g), the cost of the Resin needed for the skin would be 38.50GBP.</p>
