								<h2>Unused Techniques</h2>
								<p>
									This page discusses techniques that were not used during the production of the project. Whilst they may have been considered, they were deemed ill-suited to the aims and artefact this project aimed to deliver, so were not chosen for use. The following sections
									explore these techniques more briefly than the techniques that were used, but provide reasoning as to their exclusion, as well as some examples of industry they are well-suited to.

									<h3>3D Scanning</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									3D Scanning provides precise digital replicas of real-world objects, spaces, or environments. For this reason it has invaluable use in reverse engineering, especially as it is a non-destructive data collection method. It can also be used for architecture for the purposes
									of design validation. Whilst it can have high-speed with smaller objects (faster than attempting to create the model in a 3D modelling application such as Blendr), it encounters challenges with transparent or reflective surfaces. Furthermore, there is typically a high
									equipment cost, and requires a large amount of manual labour and time to scan a complex, large area <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08863" target="_blank">[7]</a>. This technique was used to take a 3D scan of a T-rex skull for reference use in the design process, which
									is shown below. Whilst this technique was used, it was intended to test the technique. Since the project would involve creating its own skull, the technique was disregarded after the scan was taken.

									<h3>Computer Aided Design (CAD)</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Computer Aided Design (CAD) is similar to 3D Modelling, with the difference being that the model begins in 2D. Once made 3D through the help of a computer, the model can be extruded and altered similarly to 3D Modelling softwares. For example, CAD has its applications in the 
									dental industry, where 3D replicas of a patients oral structure can be recreated from an X-Ray scan or an image of the patients mouth <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-07369-4_5" target="_blank">[8]</a>. However, as with 3D Scanning, the technlogy is expensive,
									and there are concerns over the loss of traditional skills with replacement by CAD. The advantages far outweigh the negatives however, as overall CAD can significantly increase efficiency and accuracy in areas where it is employed. It was not used for this project as again, The
									modelling was to be created specifically for the project, and Blender was better suited to the needs of the project. Haptic Sculpting employs similar techniques, with the main difference being physical feedback when modelling. Due to this property, it is an excellent tool for 
									training in the medical sector, as it provides actual physical feedback with no risk attached to a person.

									<h3>Motion Capture</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									MoCap is ideal for animation and virtual character creation by capturing real, fluent movements of animals or humans by capturing the movements of a skeleton through a multitude of cameras. This skeletal frame is captured through the position of markers on the target, 
									and the range between each can differentiate between appendages. Whilst unrivaled in its use for virtual movement and animation, it requires an extremely precise calibration, which can be very time consuming. Furthemore, the technique can struggle when not in a controlled
									environment, such as outdoors, due to the environmental noise and occlusions present. Due to the fact that this project did not require any animation (and because of the lack of a living Tyrannosaurus Rex), this technique was also disregarded.

									<h3>Laser Cutting</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Laser Cutting involves the process of using a high-powered and highly calibrated laser to cut or engrave materials. It is beginning to see wider use in industry due to its superior accuracy over other technologies <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214785321056947" target="_blank">[9]</a>.
									Traditional cutting methods, such as drilling or sawing, generate a larger waste from the material than laser cutting, as the machine does not directly touch the material being processed. Laser cutting is also faster and more efficient than traditional processing
									methods, leading to a reduction in production time. As with the other techniques, a large downside of laser cutting is the initial cost of equipment. Furthermore, adequate ventilation must be ensured during the process, as the potential fumes may harm industrial personnel.<br>
									With regards to this project, laser cutting was not used as there was simply no need for it. The skull and other parts could be suitably made in a 3D Printer, and as a skull, it is designed to be hollow. Not only would laser cutting have had significant waste from attempting
									to produce a skull, it likely would not have been hollow on the inside. Laser cutting was not applicable to the project, as 3D printing was perfectly suited to the needs of the design.
