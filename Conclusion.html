								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p>
									With a multitude of techniques and materials available, the design process for the module was quite complicated. One could argue that - through learning and understanding new techniques and guidelines for how to operate various different machinery, as well as the 
									different materials available for use with each - the initial and lengthiest stage of the design was in fact to create an understanding of the various processes. This understanding was vital, yet time-consuming for the project as all of these techniques had to be learnt 
									from a low baseline of understanding. Necessary it was however, as it allowed the project to narrow-down which techniques were to be most applicable for the design, and direct focus in to a more detailed understanding of those deemed best suited. Of the various methods of 
									production available, this project opted to focus on 3D Printing, 3D Modelling, and the use of Resin. The biggest hurdle was learning Blender. Whilst it boasts a wide range of techniques and features for creating 3D models for both display and to be 3D printed, this also means
									that there is a very steep learning curve attached to the software. This is where the majority of the designs time was used, and even still there is far more that Blender has available that was not able to be fully utilised. Given more time, a higher-quality and more detailed
									model for the teeth could have been developed, with varying sizes and different textures to imitate age or condition of the teeth. <br>
									Were this project to be repeated, the time allotted to studying resin would have been given to 3D Modelling instead, with the goal of producing a full T-Rex skull in Blender with an animated example of the Jawhinge working. The upper and lower teeth would be more detailed with
									varying sizes, and the shafts & bearings would also be incorporated into one complete model. Whilst the parts would be printed separately and fitted afterwards, a complete working model of the design would have aided this project greatly. If time still allowed, the resin would
									be produced using CS25 Silicone Rubber still, as discussed previously. Furthermore, laser cutting could potentially have been used to provide the texture idealised during the development process. If not on the skin, the skull could have had a suitable rough texturing, alongside the
									teeth. This would provide a more realistic feel to the skull. The applications of laser cutting on printed plastics would have to be investigated in this renewed development, however.
